                         Python Tuples

                Tuple is a data type in python

                          (1, 3, 8)


                Tuple is like a carved stones.

                Unlike the values in list can be changed, the values in tuple can't be changed.

                my_tuple[2] = 14

                   my_tuple[2] = 14
                    ~~~~~~~~^^^

                TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

                Tuple is immutable

my_tuple = (1, 2, 7)
my_tuple[2]
print(my_tuple[2])

list(my_tuple)

print(list(my_tuple))
